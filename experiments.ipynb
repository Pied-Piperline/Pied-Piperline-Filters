Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!\\nPresident Trump offered no condolences to those killed in the California wildfires, but did use a tweet on Saturday to cast blame for the blazes on “gross mismanagement of the forests.”\\nTrump said “billions of dollars are given each year,” and threatened “no more Fed payments” if it isn’t improved.\\nThis isn’t the first time Trump has blamed regulations for wildfires in the Democrat-run state.\\nIn August, as fires ravaged California’s north, he lashed out at Gov. Jerry Brown and the state’s water and tree-clearing laws.\\nBut, fire officials hit back, they had plenty of access to water. Critics also accused Trump of being more concerned with clearing public lands for development.\\nRead more from August: Baffled Experts Say Trump Is Completely Clueless On California Fire Policies\\n—Julia Reinstein\\nAn owl sits on the beach in Malibu as the Woolsey Fire approaches.\\nThree major wildfires burning in California have forced hundreds of thousands of people to evacuate, which has also meant an exodus of animals escaping the flames.\\nIn Northern California, the Camp fire had killed at least nine people as of Friday and scorched more than 6,700 structures, making it the most destructive in state history.\\nMeanwhile, less than 24 hours after a mass shooting in Thousand Oaks, more than 200,000 residents in Southern California were ordered to flee their homes as the Woolsey and Hill fires tore though the region.\\nBut mass evacuations meant everything from pet dogs to farm animals and wildlife have also needed to find respite, making for dramatic pictures.\\nRead more: These Haunting Photos Show Animals Fleeing The Massive California Wildfires\\n—Stephanie K. Baer\\nThe Camp fire in Northern California on Friday became the most destructive in state history, with the death toll also climbing to at least nine.\\nThe Butte County Sheriff’s Office announced that it had recovered four more bodies from the fire’s aftermath — one near a vehicle on the road, and the others outside residences.\\nEarlier in the day, five people were found dead inside charred vehicles, apparently overtaken by wind-whipped flames. The Camp fire spread so rapidly that entire towns were forced to evacuate almost simultaneously. On highways, traffic slowed to a crawl, prompting many people to abandon their vehicles.\\nIn addition to taking a toll on human life, the Camp fire has proven to be the most destructive in state history, destroying 6,713 structures across 90,000 acres, according to Cal Fire. As of Friday night, it was just 5% contained, as it continued to rage in gusty winds across dry landscapes, practically razing the town of Paradise.\\nThe Tubbs fire, which tore through Napa and Sonoma counties in 2017, had previously held the No. 1 rank, with 5,636 structures destroyed and 36,807 acres burned.\\nTwo other major wildfires also continued to ravage Southern California, but so far, no deaths have been attributed to the Woolsey or Hill fires as they destroyed one home after another and prompted entire cities, including Malibu, to evacuate.\\n—Blake Montgomery\\nAuthorities say a sixth person has died in the Camp fire in Northern California.\\nButte County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Megan McMann confirmed the death to the Associated Press Friday, but did not have any details on the circumstances.\\nEarlier, the sheriff’s office said the bodies of at least five people had been found in charred vehicles overtaken by the fire near the town of Paradise.\\nOfficials said the victims could not be immediately identified because of burn injuries.\\n—Stephanie K. Baer\\nPacific Gas & Electric, the largest power company in Northern California, told state regulators Friday that an electrical transmission line experienced an outage just 15 minutes before the deadly Camp fire started on Nov. 8.\\nIn a preliminary report to the California Utilities Commission, PG&E stated that a survey of the power line from the air in the afternoon found damage to a transmission tower along the line.\\nThe Camp fire practically destroyed the town of Paradise and has been blamed for at least five deaths as it continues to rage through thousands of acres of dry vegetation.\\nCal Fire investigators previously found that power lines and related equipment owned by PG&E started 16 fires in October 2017 alone. The company has currently shut off power to tens of thousands of people across California as a precaution and to assist firefighting efforts for the Camp fire, as well as the Woolsey and Hill fires in Southern California, according to its outage map.\\nThe company\\'s regulatory relations department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\\n—Blake Montgomery\\nThe Woolsey fire more than doubled in size to 35,000 acres by Friday evening, prompting evacuations across Southern California\\'s coast and canyons.\\nWith heavy winds in the forecast for Sunday, firefighters expected the blaze to also grow through the weekend.\\n\"We’re in the seventh year of a drought,\" Ventura County Fire Chief Mark Lorenzen told reporters. \"Our weather conditions, our hill conditions are absolutely ripe for fire.\"\\nOfficials had no immediate estimate of how many homes and structures has been lost so far, but one large house after another could be seen lighting up in flames in aerial news footage throughout the day.\\nGusty winds and low visibility had at times on Friday grounded aircraft dropping water and fire retardant onto flames. Firefighters were also waiting on hundreds of requested vehicles and personnel to assist them, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby said.\\n\"We’re competing with other fires in the state of California,\" he said, adding that more resources would be coming in from out of state.\\nHe urged residents to heed evacuation orders. A few times on Friday, firefighters had come across people staying in threatened homes.\\n\"When you do that, that puts your lives at risks and our firefighters lives at risk,\" Osby said. \"I can only imagine the impact of someone asking you to leave your home, but we’re doing it for your safety.\"\\nAbout 75% of Thousand Oaks\\' population had been told to leave their homes, undoubtedly meaning that some of the evacuees were people affected by Wednesday night\\'s deadly shooting at the Borderline Bar & Grill, Mayor Andy Fox said.\\n\"Some of the folks that were affected by the shooting just a few days ago likely were asked to leave their home on top of that,\" he said.\\nHe asked people to keep victims and their families in their thoughts and prayers. Their loss went beyond that of residents affected by the fire, he added.\\n\"Thankfully, we’ve not lost a single life,\" he said of the wildfire. \"And difficult as it may be, homes can be rebuilt.\"\\n—Claudia Koerner\\nDozens of homes had burned in Malibu by Friday afternoon as firefighters continued to respond to reports of people trapped by the Woolsey fire.\\nHomes in the Kanan-Dume area were destroyed, and Point Dume was also hard hit by the fast-moving blaze. A firefighter told BuzzFeed News it was as bad as the 1993 wildfire that devastated the city, and possibly worse.\\nThe entire city was under evacuation, but emergency calls of residents trapped and unable to flee continued to come in Friday afternoon. Power lines were down, and cars weren’t allowed on roads to make way for emergency vehicles.\\nBut in some neighborhoods, residents couldn’t stay away. They checked on their homes, circumventing road closures on foot or on bicycles.\\n—Brianna Sacks and Claudia Koerner\\nVIDEO: @LACoFireAirOps Firehawk helicopter flying along Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu on the way to protect life and property.

    "When it comes to romance, watching a great movie can be the perfect way for couples to pass the time and get a little closer. They're entertaining, easily shared experiences, and they tend to teach us a thing or two about each other's tastes. Not only that, but movies can also be a great excuse to get cozy next to that special someone on the couch or love seat. You can't say the same for reading a magazine, right? No one ever got married after sharing a copy of Newsweek.But some films, while they're great, are movies you should never watch with your partner. Why? Because you'll probably want to avoid arguments, general awkwardness, or even an air of sudden distrust. Nothing makes your sofa go from snuggle-central to the creepy zone quicker than these movies. The films on this list are totally worth your time…as long as you're by yourself.\n",
